### ðŸ‘‹
This is very much a quick and dirty project to scratch my own itch. Don't expect much as far as support, updates, or response to github issues.

### What's broken?
The part of the extension that affects the Jira pages is broken. I never got a chance to update to the new Jira markup. 
I don't know if Jira supports multiple versions of the web app which might mean it might still work with an older version. 

### Get started
1. follow instructions in config.example.js
2. Maybe follow this for loading an extesion locally: https://medium.com/@aabroo.jalil/how-to-test-a-chrome-extension-locally-step-by-step-guide-852e4622d4c7


Note to self
fetch by key, not sure if still works
${jiraConfig.jira_base_url}/rest/api/2/search?jql=key=OCTO-5038%20or%20key=OCTO-5082
